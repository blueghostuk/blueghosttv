	<h1>About Page</h1>
	<p>This site is built on my own PHP parser for the TV-Anytime files provied by bbc backstage, it also parses listings from bleb.org/tv.</p>
	<p>I plan to release the code for the parser once I've made it more legible</p>
	<p>"Search this page" works by collecting all the links on the page and then searching them. It uses javascript hence you need javascript enabled for it to work.</p>
	<p>Other scripts used are:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/945.html" target="_blank">TAR/GZIP/BZIP2/ZIP ARCHIVE CLASSES 2.1 | By Devin Doucette | Copyright (c) 2005 Devin Doucette</a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Data can be cached, so if a file appears blank it should be updated if you refresh the file. If not chances are it does not exist any more.</p>
	<p>DVD/Book/CD etc Data supplied from Amazon UK. All of this data is subject to change and prices cannot be guaranteed although a last update time is quoted.</p>
