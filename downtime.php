<h1>Just a quick update</h1>
<p>
Since my web-host updated to php 5 only alot of my download + db loading code doesn't work - odd since it was working in php5 mode before.<br />
Anyway most of the site does not work, however bbc data is loaded at present and the "Search All Programs: " ajax search above should work in most instances. <br />
Hopefully any rss feeds will still work (except now and next).

I'll try to keep this text updated
